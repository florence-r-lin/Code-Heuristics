installations:
pip install openai

environment variable:
see my SFA log for the api key
in your terminal:
- macs: export OPENAI_API_KEY="key"
- windows: set OPENAI_API_KEY="key"

can tinker with the input message, just make sure its in the right format of a string
you can also change the model to:
- gpt-4o
- gpt-4-turbo
bear in mind that it may cost slightly more to use these models to do API calls ($10 on the account), granted making these API calls are pretty cheap
